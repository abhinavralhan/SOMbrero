## A faire

** JB : remove variable names for somplot and scplot for Relational?

** JB : allow the user to download the clustering of the SOM directly

** JB : what is standard value for h in superClass?

** MC : add an option in input (shiny) to indicate which variable contains the
observation name

** MC : for lines, display all observations and not the mean

** NVV : check print.titles for all SC plots

** MC : improved colors in prototypes/MDS because SC are very light

** NVV : check that plot.legend works for everything in SC

** MC : possibility to choose additional variables within the original table

** MC : ficelle -> check all features (especially 3D plots)
